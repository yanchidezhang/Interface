        <p><strong>Data Collection and Sampling</strong></p>

        <p>We collected a corpus of tweets about the 2017 UK general election through Twitter’s streaming API, tracking
            14 <a href="#hashtags" aria-describedby="footnote-label" id="hashtags-ref">hashtags</a>. Data harvesting was
            performed between 26th May and 21st June 2017 to capture the ongoing
            discussion in the 2 weeks running up to the election and then the two week post-election period. In order to
            identify relevant topic-entities in each tweet, we match tweets against two manually curated lists of
            keywords (both were created during the 2015 UK election cycle). The following include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>A list of 438 topic keywords relevant to 9 popular election <a href="#issues"
                                                                               aria-describedby="footnote-label"
                                                                               id="issues-ref">issues</a>. The initial
                list of 420 seed words
                provided by a team of journalists was augmented by searching for similar words within a vector space on
                the basis of cosine similarity.
            </li>
            <li>A list of 71 political-party names relevant to 9 political parties such as “tories” and “lib dems”.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>In the resulting corpus each tweet contains at least one keyword (i.e. topic-entity) from the two lists
            above. To make sure we have a high quality low noise corpus, we have trained a Twitter spam detection model
            using the data and user features described in [1] and filtered out those that are identified as spam tweets
            by the model.</p>

        <p><strong>Sentiment Classification</strong></p>

        <p>An early study by [2] showed that 40% of Twitter sentiment classification errors are caused by using
            tweet-level approaches that are independent of the target/topic entities. Here we go beyond of tweet-level
            approaches and adopt the multi-target-specific approach proposed in [3], which finds the syntactically
            connected parts of a tweet to each topic-entity and then extracts word embedding features from these
            syntactically dependent tokens in order to calculate the sentiment. It was shown to obtain state-of-the-art
            performance in two data sets. Each topic-entity instance is classified as ‘negative’, ‘positive’ or
            ‘neutral’.</p>

        <p><strong>Tweet Summarisation</strong></p>

        <p>Here we extract a list of representative tweets summarising the sentiment(s) expressed towards each topic
            entity at each day (e.g. tweets containing positive sentiment towards ‘green party’ posted at 26th May
            2017).
            As a prerequisite for summarisation, we further group tweets containing the same sentiment towards a topic
            or entity on each day into a number of clusters, with each cluster presumably representing a theme or
            reasons surrounding the particular choice of sentiment. We adopt the
            two-stage hierarchical topic modelling approach proposed in [4] and select the GSDMM+OLDA model for this
            task. If there are fewer than 10 unique tweets containing the same sentiment towards a topic entity on a
            particular day, we skip the tweet clustering step and treat these tweets as one cluster.
            To extract representative tweets for summarising each cluster, we place every tweet in one common embedding
            space and find 20 tweets that are the closest to the cluster centroid (also known as metroid tweets) as
            summary candidates. We select the most informative tweet from the 20 candidates as the summary for that
            cluster, and the final summary for the sentiment expressed towards the topic entity is the summaries
            combined from all its clusters (e.g. tweets containing positive sentiment towards ‘green party’ posted on
            26th May 2017, comprise 8 clusters and therefore a list of 8 representative tweets as their summary).
